## Real-world Examples

### Example 1: Adding a New Dependency

**Scenario**: Team wants to add `lodash` library to the project

**Security Champion Response:**
```markdown
## Position: Conditional Support

### Executive Summary
While lodash is a well-maintained library, adding dependencies increases our attack surface. I support this addition only with proper security measures in place.

### Key Arguments
1. **Supply Chain Risk**
   - Evidence: 2021 saw 650% increase in supply chain attacks
   - Impact: Each dependency adds ~80 transitive dependencies
   - Priority: High

2. **Known Vulnerabilities**
   - Evidence: Lodash had critical prototype pollution (CVE-2020-8203)
   - Impact: Could lead to RCE in certain conditions
   - Priority: Medium

### Recommendations
1. Use specific imports: `import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'`
2. Implement Dependabot for automated security updates
3. Add to security scanning in CI pipeline
4. Consider native alternatives for simple functions
```

**Performance Engineer Response:**
```markdown
## Position: Oppose

### Executive Summary
Lodash adds 71KB to our bundle size. Modern JavaScript provides native alternatives for most lodash functions with better performance.

### Key Arguments
1. **Bundle Size Impact**
   - Evidence: Full lodash = 71KB, even with tree-shaking ~25KB
   - Impact: 15% increase in initial load time
   - Priority: High

2. **Runtime Performance**
   - Evidence: Native Array.prototype.map is 50% faster than _.map
   - Impact: Cumulative performance degradation
   - Priority: Medium

### Recommendations
1. Use native ES6+ features instead
2. If needed, implement specific utilities locally
3. Consider lodash-es for better tree-shaking
4. Benchmark specific use cases before deciding
```

### Example 2: Changing API Structure

**Scenario**: Proposal to change from REST to GraphQL

**Architecture Guardian Response:**
```markdown
## Position: Support with Conditions

### Executive Summary
GraphQL aligns with modern API design principles but requires careful implementation to maintain architectural integrity.

### Key Arguments
1. **Improved Client-Server Decoupling**
   - Evidence: Reduces over-fetching by 60% in our use cases
   - Impact: Better separation of concerns
   - Priority: High

2. **Schema-First Design**
   - Evidence: Forces explicit contract definition
   - Impact: Better API documentation and type safety
   - Priority: High

### Concerns and Risks
- **Complexity**: N+1 query problems without proper data loader
- **Caching**: More complex than REST caching strategies

### Recommendations
1. Implement DataLoader pattern from day one
2. Use schema federation for microservices
3. Maintain REST endpoints during transition
4. Document migration path for clients
```

**UX Advocate Response:**
```markdown
## Position: Strong Support

### Executive Summary
GraphQL significantly improves user experience by reducing loading times and enabling responsive interfaces.

### Key Arguments
1. **Reduced Loading Times**
   - Evidence: 40% reduction in page load time (internal metrics)
   - Impact: Direct improvement in user satisfaction
   - Priority: High

2. **Flexible Data Fetching**
   - Evidence: Mobile users can request minimal data
   - Impact: Better experience on slow connections
   - Priority: High

### UX Benefits
- Real-time updates with subscriptions
- Predictable error handling
- Progressive data loading
- Reduced spinner/loading states

### Recommendations
1. Implement proper loading states for partial data
2. Design clear error boundaries
3. Provide query complexity feedback
4. Create developer-friendly playground
```

### Example 3: Performance vs Readability Trade-offs

**Scenario**: Optimized algorithm that's harder to understand

```javascript
// Original (readable)
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const seen = {};
  const duplicates = [];
  
  for (const item of arr) {
    if (seen[item]) {
      duplicates.push(item);
    } else {
      seen[item] = true;
    }
  }
  
  return duplicates;
}

// Optimized (less readable)
const findDuplicates = arr => 
  arr.filter((v,i,a) => a.indexOf(v) !== i && a.lastIndexOf(v) === i);
```

**Performance Engineer Response:**
```markdown
## Position: Oppose the "Optimized" Version

### Executive Summary
The "optimized" version is actually O(n²) complexity versus O(n) for the original. This is a performance regression disguised as clever code.

### Performance Analysis
1. **Time Complexity**
   - Original: O(n) - single pass with hash table
   - "Optimized": O(n²) - indexOf is O(n) for each element
   - Impact: 1000x slower for 1000 elements

2. **Benchmark Results**
   ```
   Array size 1000: Original: 0.5ms, "Optimized": 487ms
   Array size 10000: Original: 5ms, "Optimized": 45,892ms
   ```

### Recommendation
Keep the original implementation. If optimization needed:
```javascript
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const duplicates = new Set();
  
  for (const item of arr) {
    if (seen.has(item)) {
      duplicates.add(item);
    }
    seen.add(item);
  }
  
  return Array.from(duplicates);
}
```
```

**Testing Specialist Response:**
```markdown
## Position: Support Original Version

### Executive Summary
The readable version is significantly easier to test and verify correctness. The "optimized" version has subtle bugs and edge cases.

### Testing Concerns
1. **Bug in "Optimized" Version**
   - Fails for arrays with more than 2 occurrences
   - Example: [1,1,1,2] returns [1] instead of [1,1]
   - This demonstrates the danger of clever code

2. **Test Maintainability**
   - Original: Clear test cases, easy to debug
   - "Optimized": Requires complex mental model
   - Impact: Higher maintenance cost

### Test Cases Revealing Issues
```javascript
describe('findDuplicates', () => {
  it('handles multiple duplicates', () => {
    expect(findDuplicates([1,1,1,2])).toEqual([1,1]);
    // "Optimized" fails this test
  });
  
  it('preserves order of first duplicate', () => {
    expect(findDuplicates([3,1,3,2,1])).toEqual([3,1]);
    // "Optimized" returns [1,3] - wrong order
  });
});
```
```

### Example 4: Security Hardening Proposals

**Scenario**: Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Security Champion Response:**
```markdown
## Position: Strong Support with Phased Approach

### Executive Summary
CSP is critical for preventing XSS attacks, but must be implemented carefully to avoid breaking functionality.

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1: Report-Only Mode**
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: 
     default-src 'self';
     script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://trusted-cdn.com;
     report-uri /api/csp-reports
   ```

2. **Phase 2: Tighten Policies**
   - Remove 'unsafe-inline' using nonces
   - Implement strict-dynamic
   - Add upgrade-insecure-requests

3. **Phase 3: Enforcement**
   - Switch to enforcement mode
   - Monitor violation reports
   - Maintain allowlist

### Risk Mitigation
- 2-week report-only period
- Gradual rollout by user percentage
- Rollback plan ready
- Exception handling for legacy browsers
```

**UX Advocate Response:**
```markdown
## Position: Conditional Support

### Executive Summary
CSP can break user functionality if not carefully implemented. We must ensure zero user-facing disruption.

### UX Concerns
1. **Third-party Integrations**
   - Impact: Chat widgets, analytics, payment forms
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive allowlist before enforcement

2. **Dynamic Content**
   - Impact: User-generated content, rich text editors
   - Mitigation: Implement nonce-based approach

### Requirements for Support
1. Zero false positives in report-only mode for 2 weeks
2. A/B test with 1% of users first
3. Clear error messages if content is blocked
4. Support documentation for affected features
5. Gradual rollout with monitoring

### User Communication Plan
- In-app notifications for affected features
- Help center articles ready
- Support team trained on CSP issues
```

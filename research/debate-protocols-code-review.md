## Structured Argumentation Frameworks

### 1. Toulmin Model of Argumentation

The Toulmin model provides a structured method for generating and analyzing coherent, detailed arguments. It consists of six components:

- **Claim**: The assertion that needs to be proven
- **Grounds**: Evidence and facts supporting the claim
- **Warrant**: The assumption linking grounds to the claim
- **Backing**: Additional support for the warrant
- **Qualifier**: Limits the scope of the claim
- **Rebuttal**: Acknowledges alternative viewpoints

**Application to Code Review:**
```
Claim: "This function should use memoization"
Grounds: "Performance profiling shows 80% CPU time spent here"
Warrant: "Repeated calculations with same inputs waste resources"
Backing: "Industry best practices recommend memoization for pure functions"
Qualifier: "When memory usage is not a primary constraint"
Rebuttal: "Unless the function is rarely called with same inputs"
```

### 2. IBIS (Issue-Based Information System)

IBIS is an argumentation-based approach for clarifying complex problems involving multiple stakeholders. Core elements include:

- **Issues (I)**: Questions that need answers
- **Positions (P)**: Possible answers or ideas
- **Arguments (AS/AO)**: Supporting (pros) or objecting (cons) arguments

**IBIS Notation Example:**
```
I: Should we refactor the authentication module?
  P1: Yes, implement OAuth 2.0
    AS: Industry standard, better security
    AO: Breaking changes for existing users
  P2: No, maintain current system
    AS: No migration needed, stable
    AO: Technical debt accumulating
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Makes design process transparent
- Encourages wider participation
- Provides traceable decision history
- Supports collaborative problem-solving

### 3. Dialogue Mapping

A facilitation method using IBIS notation to map design dialogues as they evolve. Particularly useful for:
- Real-time code review sessions
- Architecture decision records
- Post-mortem analyses

## Debate Protocols from Competitive Programming and CTF

### CTF (Capture the Flag) Competition Structures

CTF competitions demonstrate effective collaborative argumentation in technical contexts:

**1. Attack/Defense Style**
- Red Team: Proposes vulnerabilities and exploits
- Blue Team: Defends with counterarguments and fixes
- Structured rounds of attack and defense
- Clear scoring based on successful arguments

**2. Jeopardy Style**
- Teams solve challenges across categories
- Collaborative argumentation within teams
- Evidence-based solutions required
- Time-boxed discussions

### Competitive Programming Debate Elements

**Key Practices:**
1. **Solution Defense**: Participants must justify algorithmic choices
2. **Complexity Arguments**: Big-O analysis as formal argumentation
3. **Edge Case Debates**: Systematic exploration of boundary conditions
4. **Optimization Trade-offs**: Structured discussions on time vs. space

## Formal Verification Approaches

### 1. Deductive Verification Protocol

**Structure:**
```
1. Specification: Formal property definition
2. Proof Obligations: Mathematical requirements
3. Evidence: Automated theorem prover results
4. Verification: Independent validation
```

**LLM Implementation:**
- Agent 1: Proposes formal specifications
- Agent 2: Generates proof obligations
- Agent 3: Validates and challenges proofs

### 2. Model Checking Debate

**Protocol:**
```
1. Model Construction: System representation
2. Property Specification: Safety/liveness claims
3. Counterexample Analysis: Automated exploration
4. Refinement Debate: Model adjustments
```

### 3. Abstract Interpretation Framework

- **Claim**: Code property holds for all inputs
- **Abstraction**: Simplified domain analysis
- **Soundness Argument**: Mathematical proof
- **Precision Debate**: Trade-off discussions

## Evidence-Based Technical Arguments

### 1. Code-Based Evidence

**Protocol:**
```python
def argument_with_code():
    """
    Claim: Algorithm X is more efficient than Y
    Evidence: Benchmarked implementation
    """
    # Implementation and benchmarks
    return measured_performance
```

### 2. Data-Driven Arguments

**Structure:**
1. **Hypothesis**: Clear technical claim
2. **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements
3. **Analysis**: Statistical significance
4. **Visualization**: Clear data presentation
5. **Conclusion**: Evidence-based decision

### 3. Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

**Template:**
```markdown
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected]

## Context
[Problem description and constraints]

## Decision
[Chosen solution]

## Arguments For
- [Evidence 1]
- [Evidence 2]

## Arguments Against
- [Counter-evidence 1]
- [Risk analysis]

## Consequences
[Impact analysis]
```

## Consensus Mechanisms and Voting Systems

### 1. Rough Consensus (IETF Model)

**Process:**
1. **Discussion Phase**: Open argumentation
2. **Humming**: Non-binding preference indication
3. **Objection Handling**: Address strong disagreements
4. **Chair Decision**: "Sense of the group"

**LLM Implementation:**
- Multiple agents propose solutions
- Weighted preference aggregation
- Objection threshold detection
- Consensus articulation

### 2. Hybrid Consensus-Voting

**Protocol:**
```
1. Consensus Attempt (Time-boxed)
   - Collaborative refinement
   - Compromise exploration
   
2. Voting Fallback
   - Structured ballot from discussion
   - Qualified majority threshold
   - Minority report option
```

### 3. Weighted Technical Voting

**Factors:**
- **Expertise Weight**: Domain knowledge consideration
- **Impact Assessment**: Change scope analysis
- **Risk Evaluation**: Security/stability concerns

## Debate-Driven Development Processes

### 1. Dialectical Development

**Process:**
```
Thesis: Initial implementation
Antithesis: Code review challenges
Synthesis: Improved solution
```

**Implementation:**
- Agent A: Proposes code solution
- Agent B: Systematic critique
- Agent C: Synthesis and refinement

### 2. Adversarial Code Review

**Structure:**
1. **Advocate**: Defends implementation choices
2. **Challenger**: Identifies weaknesses
3. **Judge**: Evaluates arguments
4. **Iteration**: Refinement rounds

### 3. Socratic Method for Code Review

**Questions Framework:**
- "What assumptions does this code make?"
- "How does this handle edge cases?"
- "What alternatives were considered?"
- "What evidence supports this approach?"

## Implementation Guidelines for LLM Agents

### 1. Multi-Agent Debate System

```python
class DebateAgent:
    def __init__(self, role, expertise):
        self.role = role  # advocate, critic, synthesizer
        self.expertise = expertise
    
    def generate_argument(self, code, context):
        # Structured argument generation
        pass
    
    def evaluate_argument(self, argument):
        # Evidence-based evaluation
        pass
```

### 2. Argument Quality Metrics

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Relevance**: Addresses the specific issue
- **Evidence**: Supported by code/data
- **Completeness**: Covers edge cases
- **Clarity**: Well-structured presentation
- **Impact**: Significance of the point

### 3. Debate Orchestration Protocol

```yaml
debate_protocol:
  phases:
    - initialization:
        duration: 5_minutes
        actions: 
          - identify_issues
          - assign_roles
    
    - argumentation:
        rounds: 3
        time_per_round: 10_minutes
        structure:
          - claim_presentation
          - evidence_submission
          - rebuttal_opportunity
    
    - synthesis:
        duration: 5_minutes
        outputs:
          - consensus_summary
          - action_items
          - unresolved_issues
```

### 4. Integration with Code Review Tools

**Structured Output Format:**
```json
{
  "debate_summary": {
    "issue": "Performance optimization needed",
    "consensus": "Implement caching with LRU strategy",
    "dissenting_opinions": ["Consider lazy loading instead"],
    "evidence": {
      "benchmarks": "link_to_results",
      "profiling": "link_to_data"
    },
    "action_items": [
      {
        "task": "Implement LRU cache",
        "assignee": "Agent_1",
        "rationale": "Benchmarks show 3x improvement"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 5. Continuous Learning Integration

**Feedback Loop:**
1. Record debate outcomes
